# Instructions

To test our simulation model, first ensure you have Python 2.7 and the
matplotlib Python module installed. Then, simply execute:

```
$ python driver.py
```

This will perform a test simulation with 500 pedestrians moving throughout a
relatively simple SUI corresponding to a system of sidewalks and roads. The
SUI included with this simulation can be visualized in `playMat.png`.

The output will initially state that a preprocessing step is being performed
to prepare the simulation. Then, the actual simulation will automatically begin.
Pedestrians will be created and will begin moving toward their destinations. As
they do, the number of "active pedestrians" remaining in the SUI will be
displayed at every time step.
